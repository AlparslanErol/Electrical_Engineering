# Up-Down-BCD-Counting-the-Number-of-Pushes-on-Button-and-Its-Implementation
Design a parallel loadable, 2-digit up/down BCD counter. Counting is done by pressing and releasing a push-button switch. By pressing and releasing one of the three push-button switches, the counter can be parallel loaded, up-counted or down-counted. The content of the counter is displayed on two 7-segment LED displays. This counter is implemented on the FPGA board.
