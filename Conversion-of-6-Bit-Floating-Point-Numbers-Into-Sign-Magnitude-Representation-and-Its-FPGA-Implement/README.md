# Conversion-of-6-Bit-Floating-Point-Numbers-Into-Sign-Magnitude-Representation-and-Its-FPGA-Implement
design a decoder that converts a companded 6-bit floating point representation into sign-magnitude representation and then show the result in BCD format using 7-segment LED displays. This decoder is implemented on the FPGA board.
